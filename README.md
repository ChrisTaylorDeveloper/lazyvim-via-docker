# LazyVim via Docker

A very thin wrapper around the LazyVim Docker instructions. See https://www.lazyvim.org/installation

> It is recommended to run :LazyHealth after installation. This will load all
plugins and check if everything is working correctly.

## Getting started

```shell
./build-and-run.sh /path/to/volume/dir
```

## TODO

Resolve more of the warnings which are visible when running `:LazyHealth`
